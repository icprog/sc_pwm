Key Features
============

  * The components can be configured for Leading edge, Trailing edge and Center edge variations
  * Configurable timestep, resolution
  * PWM single bit component generates PWM signals on upto 16 1-bit ports from a single thread.
  * PWM multi bit component generates the PWM signals on a single 4, 8 or 16 bit port.

Firmware Overview
=================

The components will run in a par with the following function which does not terminate. A single function starts the pwm server and passes it a channel with 
which it will communicate with the client, a clock block required for the clocking of the required ports, an array of ports on which the pwm signals will be generated, and the number of ports in the array.
